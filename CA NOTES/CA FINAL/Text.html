    <p class="Definition"><strong>* 2.1 Bearer plants Means:</strong> These are the living plants which bear
        agricultural produce and are not agricultural produce themselves. <br> Eg: Coconut Tree, Mango Tree & All Fruit
        plantations.<br><br> - They are expected to bear the produce for more than 12 months (e.g., Wheat grain
        plantation will bear the wheat in less than 12 months and then will be chopped off. Hence not a bearer plant).
        <br><br> - There is a remote likelihood of the plant itself being sold as agricultural produce except for
        incidental scrap sales (e.g., A banana & Mango Trees is held for the produce. However, ultimately the tree may
        need to be cut down and sold. Classification will be based on primary intention and hence it is a bearer plant).
